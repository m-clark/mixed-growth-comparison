# Introduction

Mixed models and latent growth curves (LGC) are common approaches to dealing with longitudinal/repeated measures data.  I have demonstrated their equivalence elsewhere (e.g. [here](http://m-clark.github.io/docs/sem/latent-growth-curves.html) and [here](https://m-clark.github.io/docs/mixedModels/growth_vs_mixed.html)), but this document hits on some additional nuances and updates the latter.  The only model packages needed here will be <span class="pack">lme4</span>, <span class="pack">nlme</span>, and <span class="pack">lavaan</span>.

I will not be explaining these models in detail; this document is for those already somewhat familiar with them.  However, the key idea is that the random effects in the mixed model are the latent variables in the growth curve model. 

In what follows we'll examine data where clusters have multiple observations across time, and eventually other covariates will be added to the mix that are time-varying or time-constant. The following can serve as a quick reminder of what we're dealing with. The following depicts a mixed model with random intercepts and random slopes for the time covariate for observations $i$ in cluster $c$.

$$y_{ic} = \alpha_c + \beta_c \cdot \mathscr{time}_{ic} + \epsilon_{ic}$$
$$\alpha_c \sim \mathscr{N}(\mu_\alpha, \tau^2)$$
$$\beta_c \sim \mathscr{N}(\mu_\beta, \varphi^2)$$
$$\alpha_c, \beta_c \sim \mathscr{N}(\left[\begin{smallmatrix}\mu_\alpha \\ \\
\mu_\beta \end{smallmatrix}\right],
\Sigma)$$

$$\Sigma = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}\tau^2 & \rho \\
\rho & \varphi^2 \end{smallmatrix}\right]$$


$$\epsilon_{ic} \sim \mathscr{N}(0, \varsigma^2)$$
In the above we have cluster-specific coefficients, $\alpha_c$  and $\beta_c$, drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with means, $\mu_\alpha$ and $\mu_\beta$, the soi-disant 'fixed effects'. Each has their own variance ($\tau^2$ and $\varphi^2$, and some correlation $\rho$), to go along with the residual variance at the observation level ($\varsigma^2$).


The same model is depicted graphically as a growth curve model in the structural equation modeling (SEM) context (sans variances).

```{r growth_graph, echo=FALSE}

)

```


# Data setup

First things first, we need some data. Note that one could use <span class="pack">lavaan</span> to simulate the data as well if desired, but I think the following is clearer as it is more in line with standard regression.

```{r data_setup}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1234)

# data size
n = 500
timepoints = 4
N = n*timepoints

# covariates
time = rep(0:3, times=n)
x = rnorm(N)
clustervar1 = rep(0:1, e=N/2)
subject = rep(1:n, each=4)

# fixed effects
intercept = .5
slope = .25

# random effects and observation level error
randomEffectsCorr = matrix(c(.75,.2,.2,.75), ncol=2) 
randomEffects = MASS::mvrnorm(n, mu=c(0,0), Sigma = randomEffectsCorr, empirical=T) %>% 
  data.frame()
colnames(randomEffects) = c('Int', 'Slope')
sigma = .5

# target variable
y1 = 
  (intercept + randomEffects$Int[subject]) +          # random intercepts
  (slope + randomEffects$Slope[subject]) * time +     # random slopes 
  -.25 * x +                                          # time-varying covariate
   .30 * clustervar1 +                                # cluster level covariate
  rnorm(n*timepoints, mean=0, sd=sigma)               # observation level error


# create data frames
d = data.frame(subject, time, clustervar1, x, y1)


# latent growth curve models require data in 'wide' format; ignore the warning
dWide = d %>%  
  select(-x) %>% 
  spread(time, y1, -clustervar1)

colnames(dWide)[-(1:2)] = paste0('y', 0:3)

# this is ugly, but I'm not interested in figuring out the 'proper' way which
# probably would not be shorter.
dWide = dWide %>%  
  left_join(d %>%
              select(-y1) %>% 
              spread(time, x, -clustervar1))
colnames(dWide)[-(1:6)] = paste0('x', 0:3)
dWide %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits=2) %>% 
  head()
```

# Random intercepts

We start with a basic random intercept model.  This is notably different than the data generating process, so the estimates will be quite a bit off. In order to make the models produce the same results, the mixed model have to be estimated with maximum likelihood (not an issue with these sample sizes).

```{r random_intercepts_mm}
library(lme4)
mixedModel = lmer(y1 ~ time + (1|subject), data=d, REML=F)  # 1 represents the intercept
summary(mixedModel, corr=F)  # lessen clutter
```


For the LGC model, I will go ahead and keep the format that will be consistent with later models, but this means we'll have to fix some parameters so that we only have random intercepts and not slopes for the time covariate. The model also will start with the variances at each time point constrained to be equal to mimic the mixed model.  We'll relax this for both models later.

```{r random_intercepts_lgc}
library(lavaan)
model = "
  # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
  intercept =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
  time      =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3

  # time effect not allowed to vary (and thus not covary with intercept)
  time ~~ 0*time
  intercept ~~ 0*time

  # residual variance, constant across time (resvar)
  y0 ~~ resvar*y0
  y1 ~~ resvar*y1
  y2 ~~ resvar*y2
  y3 ~~ resvar*y3
"

growthCurveModel = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(growthCurveModel)
```

The `Intercepts:` section of the growth curve model output represents the fixed effects for the intercept and time coefficient. The `(resvar)` is the residual variance, while the variance for `intercept` (and in subsequent models `time`) is the random effects variance in the mixed model.  As we can see the results are identical.

# Random intercepts and slopes

Now we add random slopes for the effect of time.  I also show standardized results to make comparison of the intercept-slope correlation straightforward.

```{r random_intercepts_slopes_mm}
mixedModel = lmer(y1 ~ time + (1 + time|subject), data=d, REML=F) 
summary(mixedModel, corr=F) 
```

```{r random_intercepts_slopes_lgc}
model = "
  # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
  intercept =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
  time      =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3

  # residual variance, constant across time (resvar)
  y0 ~~ resvar*y0
  y1 ~~ resvar*y1
  y2 ~~ resvar*y2
  y3 ~~ resvar*y3
"

growthCurveModel = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(growthCurveModel, std=T)
```

The estimated effects (fixed effect + random) are identical.

```{r compare_effects}
coef(mixedModel)$subject %>% 
  bind_cols(as.tibble(lavPredict(growthCurveModel))) %>% 
  round(3) %>% 
  head(10)
```



# Add a cluster level covariate

Adding a cluster level covariate[^clustervar] to the mixed model is trivial. For the growth curve however, we will have to first add another regression equation, and fix the path from that covariate to the slope factor to be zero, otherwise our estimates will be slightly different due to the indirect path through the random intercepts.

```{r clustervar_mm}
mixedModel = lmer(y1 ~ time + clustervar1 + (1 + time|subject), data=d, REML=F)
summary(mixedModel, corr=F)
```

```{r clustervar_lgc}
model = "
  # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
  intercept =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
  time      =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3

  # cluster level effect
  intercept ~ clustervar1
  time ~ 0*clustervar1

  # residual variance
  y0 ~~ resvar*y0
  y1 ~~ resvar*y1
  y2 ~~ resvar*y2
  y3 ~~ resvar*y3
"

growthCurveModel = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(growthCurveModel, std=T)
```


# Add an interaction

Next we'll add an interaction between the cluster level covariate and time.  In almost every depiction of growth curve models I've seen, this is *assumed*, unlike any other modeling situation, where it would normally be driven by theoretical or exploratory reasons.  Note that the interaction was not part of the data generating process, and thus should be close to zero.

```{r cluster_inter_mm}
mixedModel = lmer(y1 ~ time*clustervar1 + (1 + time|subject), data=d, REML=F)  
summary(mixedModel, corr=F)
```


```{r cluster_inter_lgc}
model = "
  # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
  intercept =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
  time      =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3
  
  # both intercept and slope latent variables 'predicted' by cluster level variable
  intercept + time ~ clustervar1
  
  # residual variance
  y0 ~~ resvar*y0
  y1 ~~ resvar*y1
  y2 ~~ resvar*y2
  y3 ~~ resvar*y3
"

growthCurveModel = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(growthCurveModel, std=T)
```

In the `Regressions:` section,  the `intercept ~ clustervar1` path represents the fixed effect of `clustervar1` in the mixed model, while the `time ~ clustervar1` path coefficient is the interaction effect.


# Add a time-varying covariate

As with the cluster level covariate, adding a time-varying covariate is trivial for the mixed model, but tedious for the growth curve model.  Furthermore, for the latter we have to fix the effect to be constant over time, otherwise by default it will estimate the interaction with time.  For this demo I will revert back to having no interaction with the cluster level covariate.  This is the data generating model, and can be compared to the parameters set in the data setup at the beginning.

```{r tv_mm}
mixedModel = lmer(y1 ~ time + clustervar1 + x + (1 + time|subject), data=d, REML=F)  
summary(mixedModel, corr=F)
```

```{r tv_lgc}
model = "
  # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
  intercept =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
  time      =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3
  
  # only main effect for cluster level covariate
  intercept ~ clustervar1
  time ~ 0*clustervar1

  # add time-varying covariate 
  y0 ~ x_coef*x0
  y1 ~ x_coef*x1
  y2 ~ x_coef*x2
  y3 ~ x_coef*x3

  # residual variance
  y0 ~~ resvar*y0
  y1 ~~ resvar*y1
  y2 ~~ resvar*y2
  y3 ~~ resvar*y3
"

growthCurveModel = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(growthCurveModel, std=T)
```

Results are still the same.

# Heterogenous variances

To investigate heterogeneous variances, we'll go back to the simplest setting for the main model. This will require the <span class="pack">nlme</span> package, as <span class="pack">lme4</span> doesn't have this functionality.  The specification of the `weights` argument allows a separate variance estimated at each time point.

```{r hetero_mm}
library(nlme)
mixedModel = lme(y1 ~ time, random = ~1 + time|subject, data=d, method='ML',
                 weights=varIdent(form=~1|time))  
summary(mixedModel)
VarCorr(mixedModel) # to see variances along with standard deviations
```

```{r hetero_lgc}
model = "
  # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
  intercept =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
  time      =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3
"

growthCurveModel = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(growthCurveModel, std=T)
```

Note that the residual variance at time 0 in the growth model is the reported residual variance in the mixed model.  Unfortunately nlme is a bit convoluted[^convoluted] in reporting the actual estimated variances, which are given not only as *relative* to the time 0 estimate, but also on the standard deviation scale.  Even figuring out how to get these values is something no one can actually remember without multiple web searches.

```{r hetero_vars}
(c(1.0000000, coef(mixedModel$modelStruct$varStruct, unconstrained=F))*mixedModel$sigma)^2 %>% 
  rbind(coef(growthCurveModel)[1:4])
```

# Summary

Latent growth curve models in the standard structural equation modeling setting are mixed models that will by default:

- Estimate via maximum likelihood instead of REML
- Treat time as categorical
- Posit interactions with time
- Assume heterogeneous variances across time
- Make for notably more tedious syntax[^semsyntax]

Even when you are thinking of indirect effects, autocorrelated residual structure, etc. there are tools in R that would allow you to stay in the standard mixed model setting.  The <span class="pack">nlme</span> package (and others) provide several options for residual and other correlation structure (e.g. spatial). For certain mediation models, the <span class="pack">mediation</span> package would be able to do them with mixed models.  Adding latent class structure to mixed models can be done with <span class="pack">flexmix</span>.  Bayesian approaches are no more difficult with packages like <span class="pack">rstanarm</span> and <span class="pack">brms</span>.

More complex correlational structure (e.g. cross random effects, spatial) are not even possible in the SEM setting[^hierlgc]. If you have many time points, things only get worse for the LGC approach as far as the syntax.  Even having just a handful of covariates makes the LGC approach exceedingly complex.

I think it is very useful to think of random effects as latent variables.  However, I find little utility in explicitly modeling them that way.

[^clustervar]: In case it's not clear, this would be a time-invariant variable. If these were repeated measures on individuals, this would be something like sex or race.

[^convoluted]: Most of this package object structure and output is irksome to me, starting with the umpteen (random!) decimal places.  I have no problem admitting this may be a character flaw on my part.

[^semsyntax]: To its credit, Mplus does have some syntactical shortcuts to make things a little easier.

[^hierlgc]: At least that I'm aware of.  You can presumably incorporate hierarchical structure via as multilevel SEM, where the SEM is an LGC.
